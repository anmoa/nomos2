description: Understanding how to create and integrate tools in SOFIA
---

Tools are the primary way for SOFIA agents to interact with external systems, access data, and perform actions. This guide covers tool development in depth, including creating custom tools, integrating with packages, handling errors, and best practices.

SOFIA's tool architecture is designed for flexibility and simplicity. Tools are Python functions or classes, and are referenced by name in the `available_tools` field of each step.

### Function-based Tools

```python
def get_weather(location: str, units: str = "metric") -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location."""
    # Implementation code
    if units == "metric":
        temp = "22°C"
    else:
        temp = "72°F"
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny with a high of {temp}"
```

Register the tool with your agent:

```python
agent = Sofia(
    name="weather_agent",
    llm=llm,
    steps=steps,
    start_step_id="start",
    tools=[get_weather],
)
```

### Package-based Tools

You can reference functions from installed Python packages using the `package:function` string syntax in `tools` and `available_tools`.

```python
agent = Sofia(
    name="utility_agent",
    llm=llm,
    steps=steps,
    start_step_id="start",
    tools=["math:sqrt", "json:loads"],
)
```

### Tool Documentation

- Use type annotations and docstrings for all tool functions.
- SOFIA will auto-generate tool parameter schemas and descriptions from your code.

### Error Handling

#### Fallbacks

If a tool fails, SOFIA can use the fallback instructions provided by the tool to handle the situation gracefully. This is especially useful for tools that may fail due to network issues or other external factors.

```python
from sofia_agent.models.tool import FallbackError

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location."""
    try:
        # Implementation code here
        return f"The weather in {location} is sunny with a high of 75°F"
    except Exception as e:
        raise FallbackError(
            error="Unable to fetch weather data",
            fallback="Tell the user that the weather service is currently unavailable."
        )
```

### Tool Files

Nomos discovers tools from Python modules. When using the CLI you can supply one
or more files with `--tools`. Each file must export a list named `tools`:

```python
# tools/my_tools.py
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}!"

tools = [greet]
```

Run the agent with your custom tools:

```bash
nomos run --config config.agent.yaml --tools tools/my_tools.py
```

The CLI sets the `TOOLS_PATH` environment variable so the API server loads these
modules in place. If you're embedding Nomos in another application, set
`TOOLS_PATH` yourself to a colon-separated list of directories containing tool
modules.
