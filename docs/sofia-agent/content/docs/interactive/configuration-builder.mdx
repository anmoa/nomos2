# SOFIA Configuration Builder

Creating SOFIA agent configurations from scratch can be challenging. This interactive builder helps you design your agent flows visually and generates the corresponding YAML or JSON configuration.

## Visual Flow Designer

Design your agent's flow by adding steps, tools, and decision routes in this visual interface.

<div className="my-8 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">
  <FlowDesigner />
</div>

## How to Use the Flow Designer

1. **Add Steps**: Click the "+" button to add new steps to your flow
2. **Configure Steps**: Set the step ID, prompt, and next step
3. **Add Tools**: Attach tools to steps that need to perform actions
4. **Create Decision Routes**: Add conditional branches for decision-making steps
5. **Connect Steps**: Draw connections between steps to define the flow
6. **Preview**: See a preview of your agent's behavior
7. **Export**: Generate YAML or JSON configuration that you can use in your project

## Configuration Output

As you build your flow visually, the corresponding configuration is generated in real-time:

<div className="my-6">
  <Tabs items={["YAML", "JSON", "Python"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```yaml
      name: My Agent
      description: Agent configuration created with the visual builder
      steps:
        - id: greeting
          prompt: Greet the user and ask how you can help
          next: listen
          
        - id: listen
          prompt: Listen to the user's request
          routes:
            - when: User needs information
              goto: provide_info
            - when: User wants to perform a task
              goto: task_handler
            - default: general_help
            
        # Additional steps will appear here as you build them
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```json

        "description": "Agent configuration created with the visual builder",
        "steps": [
          {
            "id": "greeting",
            "prompt": "Greet the user and ask how you can help",
            "next": "listen"
          },
          {
            "id": "listen",
            "prompt": "Listen to the user's request",
            "routes": [
              {
                "when": "User needs information",
                "goto": "provide_info"
              },
              {
                "when": "User wants to perform a task",
                "goto": "task_handler"
              },
              {
                "default": "general_help"
              }
            ]
          }
          // Additional steps will appear here as you build them
        ]
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```python
      from sofia_agent import Sofia, Step, Route, Tool

      agent = Sofia(
          name="My Agent",
          description="Agent configuration created with the visual builder",
          steps=[
              Step(
                  id="greeting",
                  prompt="Greet the user and ask how you can help",
                  next="listen"
              ),
              Step(
                  id="listen",
                  prompt="Listen to the user's request",
                  routes=[
                      Route(when="User needs information", goto="provide_info"),
                      Route(when="User wants to perform a task", goto="task_handler"),
                      Route(default="general_help")
                  ]
              ),
              # Additional steps will appear here as you build them
          ]
      )
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

## Configuration Validator

Before using your configuration in a real application, validate it to catch potential issues:

<div className="my-6">
  <ConfigValidator />
</div>

The validator checks for:

- **Missing connections**: Ensures all steps are connected
- **Circular references**: Detects infinite loops
- **Missing definitions**: Identifies referenced tools or steps that aren't defined
- **Best practices**: Suggests improvements to your configuration

## Template Library

Jump-start your agent development with our template library:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
  <TemplateCard
    title="Customer Service Agent"
    description="Multi-step flow for handling customer inquiries and issues"
    difficulty="Beginner"
    onClick={() => loadTemplate('customer-service')}
  />

  />
  
  <TemplateCard
    title="Form-Filling Assistant"

</div>

## Save and Share

<div className="flex space-x-4 my-6">
  <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors">
    Download Configuration
  </button>
  <button className="px-4 py-2 border border-blue-600 text-blue-600 rounded hover:bg-blue-50 transition-colors">
    Share as Link

  <button className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-gray-700 rounded hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
    Copy to Clipboard
  </button>
</div>

## Next Steps

Once you've created your configuration:

1. [Install SOFIA](/docs/getting-started/installation) if you haven't already
2. Learn how to [run your agent](/docs/getting-started/quick-start#running-your-agent)
3. Explore [tool integration](/docs/concepts/tools-integration) to add capabilities
4. Review [advanced configuration](/docs/guides/configuration) for more options

<Callout type="info">
  The visual builder is a great starting point, but for complex agents, you may want to edit the configuration manually to access advanced features.
