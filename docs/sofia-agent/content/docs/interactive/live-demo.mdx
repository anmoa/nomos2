# SOFIA Live Demo

Experience SOFIA in action without installing anything. This interactive demo allows you to interact with a SOFIA agent directly in your browser.

<Callout type="warning">
  This demo runs in your browser using WebAssembly. It's a simplified version of SOFIA with limited capabilities compared to the full Python package.
</Callout>

## Demo Agent

Below is a live, interactive SOFIA agent that you can chat with. This demo agent is configured as a helpful assistant that can:

1. Answer questions about SOFIA
2. Provide code examples
3. Explain concepts
4. Demonstrate basic agent flows

<div className="my-8">
  <LiveDemo 
    initialPrompt="Hello! I'm a demo SOFIA agent. Ask me a question about SOFIA or try giving me a task."
  />
</div>

## How It Works

This demo showcases several key SOFIA features:

### Multi-step Flows

The demo agent uses a predefined flow with decision branches:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: greeting
    prompt: Introduce yourself as a SOFIA demo agent and ask how you can help
    next: listen
    
  - id: listen
    prompt: Listen to the user's query or request
    routes:
      - when: User asks about SOFIA concepts
        goto: explain_concepts
      - when: User asks for code examples
        goto: provide_examples
      - when: User asks about installation
        goto: installation_help
      - default: general_response
  
  # Additional steps not shown for brevity
```

### Tool Usage

The demo agent has access to a limited set of tools, including:

- Code generation
- Documentation search
- Basic calculations

### Decision Making

Watch how the agent analyzes your input and chooses which path to follow in its configured flow.

## Customization Options

You can modify the agent's behavior using the controls below:

<div className="my-6">
  <DemoControls />
</div>

Try adjusting the:

- **Verbosity**: How detailed the agent's responses are
- **Creativity**: How strictly the agent follows its prompts
- **Persona**: The character or role the agent assumes
- **Tools Available**: Which capabilities the agent can access

## Limitations

This browser-based demo has some limitations:

- Uses a smaller language model than the full SOFIA package
- Supports fewer tools than a server-based deployment
- Cannot access external systems or APIs
- Has limited memory and processing capabilities
