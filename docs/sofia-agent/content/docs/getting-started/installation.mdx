# Installation

SOFIA is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip. The package provides optional extras for different functionality like CLI support, LLM providers, and tracing.

## Requirements

SOFIA requires:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip or poetry for package management

## Basic Installation

pip install sofia-agent
```

If you're using poetry:

```bash
poetry add sofia-agent
```

## Installation with Extras

SOFIA provides several optional extras that you can install based on your needs:

### CLI Support

The CLI support allows you to use the `sofia init` command to bootstrap new agents:

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[cli]
```

### LLM Provider Support

Install support for specific LLM providers:

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Tracing Support

For OpenTelemetry tracing and Elastic APM integration:

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[traces]
```

### All Extras

To install all extras:

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[cli,openai,mistralai,gemini,traces]
```

## Installation from Source

If you want to install the latest development version or contribute to SOFIA:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poly-eye/sofia.git
cd sofia
poetry install
```

## Docker Installation

SOFIA provides a pre-built base Docker image that you can use to quickly containerize your agents:

```bash
docker pull chandralegend/sofia-base:latest
```

To use this image, create a Dockerfile that extends it:

```dockerfile
FROM chandralegend/sofia-base:latest

# Copy your config file
COPY config.agent.yaml /app/config.agent.yaml

# Copy your tools
COPY tools.py /app/tools/
```

Build and run your container:

```bash
docker build -t my-sofia-agent .
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here -p 8000:8000 my-sofia-agent
```

## Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify that SOFIA is installed correctly by running:

```bash
python -c "import sofia_agent; print(sofia_agent.__version__)"
```

If you installed the CLI support, you can also verify it with:

```bash
sofia --version
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have SOFIA installed, you're ready to create your first agent. Continue to our [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide to build a simple agent.
