# Introduction to SOFIA

Welcome to SOFIA (Simple Orchestrated Flow Intelligence Agent), an open-source framework designed to make building advanced LLM-powered assistants easy and intuitive.

## What is SOFIA?

SOFIA is a framework that allows you to build intelligent agents with step-based flows, tool integration, and consistent personas. It simplifies the process of creating complex AI assistants that can:

- Hold multi-turn conversations with context awareness
- Call tools and functions to perform actions
- Follow predefined conversation flows
- Maintain a consistent persona
- Handle errors gracefully

  The name SOFIA stands for **S**imple **O**rchestrated **F**low **I**ntelligence **A**gent, reflecting its core design principles.

## Core Concepts

SOFIA is built around a few fundamental concepts:

### Steps and Flows

A SOFIA agent progresses through a series of **steps**, each with a defined purpose and available tools. Steps are connected through **routes** that define the conditions for transitioning between steps.

### Tools

**Tools** are Python functions that the agent can call to perform actions or retrieve information. SOFIA provides a flexible tool integration system, allowing you to use:

- Custom Python functions
- Standard library functions via `package_name:function` syntax
- External API integrations

### Sessions

A **session** represents an ongoing conversation with an agent. Sessions maintain history, track the current step, and handle the agent's state.

### LLM Integration

SOFIA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Mistral AI, or Google's Gemini to power the agent's understanding and responses. The framework provides a consistent interface across different LLM providers.

## Use Cases

SOFIA is designed to be flexible and can be used for a variety of applications:

- Customer service chatbots
- Workflow automation agents
- Personal assistants
- Data analysis assistants
- Multi-step decision-making systems

## Getting Started

In the following sections, we'll guide you through:

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) - Setting up SOFIA in your environment
2. [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) - Creating your first SOFIA agent

Whether you prefer a no-code approach with YAML configuration or a full-code approach with Python, SOFIA provides the flexibility to build agents your way.
