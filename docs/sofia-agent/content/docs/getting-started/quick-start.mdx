# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through creating your first SOFIA agent. We'll create a simple assistant that can tell the time and perform basic calculations.

## Using the CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with the SOFIA CLI:

```bash
# Ensure you have the CLI extras installed
pip install sofia-agent[cli]

# Initialize a new SOFIA agent
sofia init
```

The CLI will guide you through creating a config file and a starter Python file for your agent.

## Python API Example

For more control, you can create an agent directly using the Python API:

```python
from sofia_agent import *
from sofia_agent.llms import OpenAIChatLLM

# Define a simple tool
def get_time():
    """Get the current time.

    Returns:
        str: The current time in string format.
    """
    from datetime import datetime
    return f"Current time: {datetime.now()}"

# Define the agent steps
steps = [
    Step(
        step_id="start",
        description="Greet and offer to tell the time or perform calculations.",
        available_tools=["get_time", "math:sqrt"],  # Direct reference to a math package function
        routes=[Route(target="end", condition="User is done")],
    ),
    Step(
        step_id="end",
        description="Say goodbye.",
    ),
]

# Create the agent
llm = OpenAIChatLLM()  # Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
agent = Sofia(
    name="clockbot",
    llm=llm,
    steps=steps,
    start_step_id="start",
    tools=[get_time, "math:sqrt"],  # Mix of custom functions and package references
    persona="You are a friendly assistant that can tell time and perform calculations.",
    max_errors=3  # Will retry up to 3 times before failing
)

# Create a session and interact with the agent
sess = agent.create_session()
decision, _ = sess.next("What time is it?")
print(f"Agent: {decision.input}")
```

<Callout type="info">
  The agent will use the `get_time` function to retrieve the current time when asked, and can call the standard library `math.sqrt` function for square root calculations.
</Callout>

## YAML Configuration Example

SOFIA also supports declarative configuration using YAML:

```yaml
name: utility-bot
persona: You are a helpful utility bot that can perform various calculations and data operations.
steps:
  - step_id: start
    description: Handle user requests for mathematical operations or data processing.
    available_tools:
      - math:sqrt
      - json:loads
      - itertools:combinations
    routes:
      - target: end
        condition: User is done with calculations
  - step_id: end
    description: Say goodbye to the user.
start_step_id: start
max_errors: 3  # Maximum consecutive errors before stopping
```

To use this configuration:

```python
import os
from sofia_agent import *
from sofia_agent.llms import OpenAIChatLLM

# Load config from YAML
config = AgentConfig.from_yaml("config.utility-bot.yaml")

# Initialize LLM
llm = OpenAIChatLLM()

# Create agent from config
agent = Sofia.from_config(llm, config)

# Create session and interact
sess = agent.create_session()
decision, _ = sess.next("Can you calculate the square root of 16?")
print(f"Agent: {decision.input}")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first agent, you can:

1. Learn about [Agent Flows](/docs/concepts/agent-flows) and how steps and routes work
2. Explore [Tool Integration](/docs/concepts/tools-integration) to add more capabilities
3. Check out the [Barista Example](/docs/examples/barista) for a more complex agent
4. Learn about [LLM Integration](/docs/concepts/llm-integration) to use different language models
