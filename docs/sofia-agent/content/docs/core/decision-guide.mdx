description: How to choose the right approach for your SOFIA agent
---

Use this guide to decide how to build and configure your SOFIA agent:

- **YAML config**: Best for no-code/low-code users, quick prototyping, and sharing agent configs.
- **Python API**: Best for full control, advanced logic, and custom integrations.
- **CLI**: Use `sofia init` to bootstrap a new agent project interactively.
- **Docker**: For production deployment, use the pre-built Docker image or build your own.

**When to use SOFIA:**
- You want explainable, step-based agent flows
- You need to integrate custom tools or external APIs
- You want to manage sessions, error handling, and extensibility out of the box

**When NOT to use SOFIA:**
- You only need a simple, stateless LLM chat
- You don’t need step-based flows or tool integration

Choose the approach that fits your team’s skills and your project’s needs.
