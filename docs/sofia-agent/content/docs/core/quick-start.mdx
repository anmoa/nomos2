Install SOFIA and run your first agent in just a few steps.

**1. Install the package:**

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[openai]
```

**2. Define a simple agent:**

```python
from sofia_agent import Sofia, Step
from sofia_agent.llms import OpenAI

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

steps = [
    Step(
        step_id="start",
        description="Greet the user and ask for their name.",
        available_tools=["greet"],
        routes=[],
    ),
]
llm = OpenAI()

agent = Sofia(
    name="greeting_agent",
    llm=llm,
    steps=steps,
    start_step_id="start",
    tools=[greet],
)
```

**3. Start the API server:**

```bash
sofia serve --config config.agent.yaml
```

**4. Interact with your agent using the API!**
