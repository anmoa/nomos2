# Test
This is a test page to check the rendering of the documentation site. It includes various elements to ensure everything is working as expected.

Imagine you have a super-smart robot helper. You can tell it what to do, give it tools (like a calculator or a weather app), and explain how to solve problems step by step. SOFIA is a way to build these smart helpers using AI, so they follow your instructions, use the right tools, and help you get things doneâ€”just like a helpful friend who always knows what to do next!
