# Business Process Automation with SOFIA

SOFIA excels at automating complex business processes that require multi-step workflows, decision-making, and integration with existing systems. This page showcases real-world examples of how SOFIA can be used for business process automation.

## Order Processing Agent

Order processing often involves multiple steps, systems, and decision points. SOFIA can streamline this process by orchestrating the entire workflow.

### Example Implementation

```yaml
name: Order Processing Agent
description: Handles customer orders from validation to fulfillment
steps:
  - id: receive_order
    prompt: Receive and validate the order details
    next: check_inventory
    
  - id: check_inventory
    tool: inventory_check
    routes:
      - when: All items in stock
        goto: process_payment
      - when: Some items out of stock
        goto: handle_backorder
      - when: All items out of stock
        goto: notify_out_of_stock
        
  - id: process_payment
    tool: payment_processor
    routes:
      - when: Payment successful
        goto: create_shipment
      - when: Payment failed
        goto: notify_payment_issue
        
  - id: create_shipment
    tool: shipping_system
    next: send_confirmation
    
  - id: send_confirmation
    tool: email_sender
    prompt: Send a detailed order confirmation with tracking information
    next: complete
    
  - id: handle_backorder
    prompt: Inform the customer about partial fulfillment options
    tool: backorder_manager
    next: process_payment
    
  - id: notify_out_of_stock
    prompt: Apologize to the customer and suggest alternatives
    tool: email_sender
    next: complete
    
  - id: notify_payment_issue
    prompt: Inform the customer about the payment issue
    tool: email_sender
    next: complete
    
  - id: complete
    prompt: Thank the customer and offer additional assistance
```

### Key Benefits

- **End-to-end automation**: Handles the entire order process without manual intervention
- **Exception handling**: Built-in support for inventory issues and payment failures
- **System integration**: Connects to inventory, payment, shipping, and notification systems
- **Consistent communication**: Maintains professional customer communication

## HR Onboarding Assistant

Employee onboarding involves multiple departments, paperwork, and system provisioning. SOFIA can coordinate this process while providing a friendly interface for new employees.

### Example Implementation

```python
from sofia_agent import Sofia, Step, Tool, Route

# Define tools
email_tool = Tool(name="send_email", function=send_email_function)
doc_tool = Tool(name="document_processor", function=process_documents)
access_tool = Tool(name="system_access", function=provision_access)
calendar_tool = Tool(name="calendar", function=schedule_meetings)

# Create onboarding agent
onboarding_agent = Sofia(
    name="HR Onboarding Assistant",
    description="Guides new employees through the onboarding process",
    steps=[
        Step(
            id="welcome",
            prompt="Welcome the new employee, introduce yourself as the onboarding assistant, and explain the onboarding process.",
            next="collect_info"
        ),
        Step(
            id="collect_info",
            prompt="Collect basic information needed for onboarding (legal name, address, emergency contacts, etc.).",
            next="process_documents"
        ),
        Step(
            id="process_documents",
            prompt="Guide the employee through required documentation.",
            tool=doc_tool,
            next="system_access"
        ),
        Step(
            id="system_access",
            prompt="Set up system access for the new employee.",
            tool=access_tool,
            next="schedule_training"
        ),
        Step(
            id="schedule_training",
            prompt="Schedule required training sessions and meetings.",
            tool=calendar_tool,
            next="welcome_email"
        ),
        Step(
            id="welcome_email",
            prompt="Send welcome email to the team introducing the new employee.",
            tool=email_tool,
            next="check_progress"
        ),
        Step(
            id="check_progress",
            prompt="Check onboarding progress and offer assistance with any incomplete items.",
            routes=[
                Route(when="Onboarding complete", goto="completion"),
                Route(when="Items pending", goto="follow_up")
            ]
        ),
        Step(
            id="follow_up",
            prompt="Follow up on pending items and provide assistance.",
            next="check_progress"
        ),
        Step(
            id="completion",
            prompt="Congratulate the employee on completing onboarding and provide resources for getting started."
        )
    ]
)
```

### Measured Results

A mid-sized technology company implemented this SOFIA onboarding agent and achieved:

- **70% reduction** in HR administrative time spent on onboarding
- **95% completion rate** of onboarding tasks within the first week
- **Improved employee satisfaction** with the onboarding process
- **Consistent documentation** across all departments

## Data Entry Automation

Data entry tasks are often repetitive but require attention to detail and validation. SOFIA can automate these processes while handling exceptions intelligently.

### Example Implementation

```yaml
name: Invoice Processing Agent
description: Extracts data from invoices and enters it into accounting systems
steps:
  - id: receive_invoice
    prompt: Process an incoming invoice document
    next: extract_data
    
  - id: extract_data
    tool: document_extraction
    routes:
      - when: Data extraction successful
        goto: validate_data
      - when: Extraction failed
        goto: manual_review
        
  - id: validate_data
    prompt: Validate the extracted invoice data
    tool: data_validator
    routes:
      - when: Data valid
        goto: categorize_invoice
      - when: Data invalid
        goto: manual_review
        
  - id: categorize_invoice
    prompt: Categorize the invoice according to accounting rules
    next: enter_data
    
  - id: enter_data
    tool: accounting_system
    routes:
      - when: Data entry successful
        goto: notify_completion
      - when: Data entry failed
        goto: manual_review
        
  - id: manual_review
    prompt: Flag for manual review with explanation of the issue
    tool: ticket_creator
    next: complete
    
  - id: notify_completion
    prompt: Notify the accounting team of successful processing
    tool: notification_system
    next: complete
    
  - id: complete
    prompt: Summarize the invoice processing results
```

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing SOFIA for business process automation:

1. **Start with process mapping**: Document your current process steps, decision points, and systems
2. **Identify integration points**: Determine which systems need to be connected via tools
3. **Design exception handling**: Plan how to handle common exceptions and edge cases
4. **Implement incrementally**: Start with a core flow and expand functionality over time
5. **Monitor and refine**: Use SOFIA's tracing capabilities to identify and improve bottlenecks
