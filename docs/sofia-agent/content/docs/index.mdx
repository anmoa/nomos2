# Introduction to SOFIA

SOFIA (Simple Orchestrated Flow Intelligence Agent) is an open-source, configurable multi-step agent framework for building advanced LLM-powered assistants. Define your agent's persona, tools, and step-by-step flows in Python or YAMLâ€”perfect for conversational, workflow, and automation use cases.

## What is SOFIA?

SOFIA provides a structured way to build LLM-powered assistants that can:

- Follow defined conversation flows
- Use tools to perform actions
- Maintain consistent personas
- Handle complex decision-making processes
- Be configured through code or YAML

<Callout type="info">
  SOFIA is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to create agents that range from simple chatbots to complex multi-step workflow systems.
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **Step-based agent flows**: Define agent behavior as a sequence of steps, each with its own tools and transitions.
- **Persona-driven**: Easily set the agent's persona for consistent, branded responses.
- **Tool integration**: Register Python functions as tools for the agent to call.
- **Package-based tools**: Reference Python package functions directly using `package_name:function` syntax.
- **Auto tool documentation**: Tool descriptions and parameter documentation are automatically generated from docstrings.
- **YAML or Python config**: Configure agents via code or declarative YAML.
- **OpenAI, Mistral, and Gemini LLM support**
- **Session management**: Save and resume conversations with Redis or PostgreSQL persistent storage.
- **Advanced error handling**: Built-in error recovery mechanisms with configurable retry limits.
- **API integration**: Ready-to-use FastAPI endpoints for web and WebSocket interaction.
- **Elastic APM tracing**: Built-in support for distributed tracing and monitoring.
- **Docker deployment**: Pre-built base image for rapid deployment.

## From No-Code to Low-Code to Full-Code

SOFIA supports a spectrum of implementation approaches:

  <Tab value="No-Code">
    **Configure agents entirely through YAML**
    
    - Reference existing Python functions using `package_name:function` syntax
    - Auto-documentation from function docstrings
    - Minimal technical knowledge required
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Low-Code">
    **Minimal Python code for custom tools**
    
    - Mix pre-existing package tools with custom tools
    - Configure complex behaviors with minimal coding
    - Use YAML for main configuration with Python extensions
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Full-Code">
    **Complete control over agent implementation**
    
    - Custom tool development
    - Advanced integrations and behaviors
    - Full flexibility for complex use cases
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Use SOFIA

SOFIA is ideal for:

- **Customer service chatbots** that follow specific conversation flows
- **Workflow automation agents** that can perform multi-step tasks
- **Personal assistants** that maintain context and perform actions
- **Data analysis assistants** that can use tools to process information
- **Multi-step decision-making systems** that need structured conversation flows
