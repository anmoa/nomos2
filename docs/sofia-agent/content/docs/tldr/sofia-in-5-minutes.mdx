<Callout type="info">
  This page provides a concise overview of SOFIA for those who want to quickly understand what it is and how it works.

## What is SOFIA?

SOFIA (**S**imple **O**rchestrated **F**low **I**ntelligence **A**gent) is an open-source framework for building advanced LLM-powered assistants with structured conversation flows and tool usage.

## 2-Minute Installation

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[openai,cli]
```

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Initialize a new agent:

```bash
sofia init
```

## 3-Minute Example

Here's a simple agent that can tell the time and perform square root calculations:

```python
from sofia_agent import *
from sofia_agent.llms import OpenAIChatLLM

# Define a simple tool
def get_time():
    """Get the current time."""
    from datetime import datetime
    return f"Current time: {datetime.now()}"

# Define steps
steps = [
    Step(
        step_id="start",
        description="Help the user with time and calculations.",
        available_tools=["get_time", "math:sqrt"],
        routes=[Route(target="end", condition="User is done")]
    ),
    Step(
        step_id="end",
        description="Say goodbye."
    )
]

# Create agent
llm = OpenAIChatLLM()
agent = Sofia(
    name="clockbot",
    llm=llm,
    steps=steps,
    start_step_id="start",
    tools=[get_time, "math:sqrt"],
    persona="You are a helpful assistant."
)

# Interact with agent
sess = agent.create_session()
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        break
    decision, _ = sess.next(user_input)
    print(f"Agent: {decision.input}")
```
