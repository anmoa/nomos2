# Decision Guide

This guide will help you decide if SOFIA is the right choice for your project, and when you might want to consider alternatives.

## When to Use SOFIA

SOFIA is ideal for the following scenarios:

### 1. Multi-Step Conversations with Structure

✅ **Use SOFIA when:** You need a conversational agent that follows a specific flow with decision points.

SOFIA excels at handling interactions that have a defined structure but need flexibility within that structure. For example:
- Customer service flows
- Troubleshooting guides
- Onboarding processes
- Interview or intake forms

### 2. Tool and System Integration

✅ **Use SOFIA when:** Your agent needs to use multiple tools and integrate with external systems.

SOFIA's tool system makes it perfect for:
- Data retrieval and analysis
- Administrative automation
- System control and orchestration
- Multi-API integration

### 3. Consistent Agent Persona

✅ **Use SOFIA when:** Maintaining a consistent tone, personality, and behavior is important.

SOFIA helps ensure consistency through:
- Centralized persona definitions
- Step-specific prompting
- Configuration-based behavior control

### 4. Complex Decision Logic

✅ **Use SOFIA when:** Your agent needs to make decisions based on user input or environmental factors.

SOFIA's routing system enables:
- Conditional branching based on input analysis
- Dynamic flow adaptation
- Context-aware responses

### 5. Configuration Over Code

✅ **Use SOFIA when:** You want the ability to modify agent behavior without coding changes.

SOFIA provides:
- YAML configuration
- Hot-reloading of agent definitions
- Separation of logic and implementation

## Comparing with Alternatives

| Feature | SOFIA | LangChain | LlamaIndex | Direct API Usage |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Flow Definition** | YAML or Python | Python code | Python code | Custom code |
| **Structured Flows** | ✅ First-class feature | 🟡 Possible, but manual | 🔴 Limited | 🔴 Manual |
| **Tool Integration** | ✅ Simple, declarative | ✅ Extensive | ✅ Good | 🔴 Manual |
| **Configuration** | ✅ YAML or Python | 🟡 Python only | 🟡 Python only | 🔴 Manual |
| **Learning Curve** | 🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High |
| **Flexibility** | 🟡 Medium-High | ✅ Very High | ✅ Very High | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Multiple options | ✅ Multiple options | ✅ Multiple options | 🟡 Manual |

## Not a Good Fit When

SOFIA might not be the best choice when:

❌ **You need a simple, stateless Q&A bot** - For simple question-answering without flow or tools, direct API usage might be simpler.

❌ **You require extensive customization of the underlying LLM behavior** - For deep LLM customization, frameworks with more low-level control might be preferable.

❌ **Your use case is primarily retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** - While SOFIA supports RAG through tools, specialized RAG frameworks might offer more advanced features.
