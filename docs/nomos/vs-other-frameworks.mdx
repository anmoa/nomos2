## Migration Strategies

<Tip>
**Gradual Migration Approach**

You don't have to choose between frameworks permanently. Many teams start with rapid prototyping in LangChain or CrewAI, then migrate critical workflows to NOMOS for production deployment.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Core Workflows">
    Map out your agent's decision points and tool usage patterns from your existing implementation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design NOMOS Flows">
    Use our Playground to visually design the equivalent structured workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incremental Implementation">
    Start with the most critical or complex parts of your agent, leaving simpler components for later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing & Validation">
    Leverage NOMOS testing capabilities to ensure your migrated agent maintains expected behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full Deployment">
    Replace your existing implementation with the more robust NOMOS version.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Possibilities

<Info>
**Best of Both Worlds**

NOMOS can integrate with existing LangChain and CrewAI tools, allowing you to leverage your existing investments while gaining structured workflow benefits.
